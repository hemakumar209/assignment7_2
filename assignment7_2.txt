1. Use the given link Data Set.
Answer the below questions:
a. Visualize the correlation between all variables in a meaningful and clear way of representing. Find out
top 3 reasons for having more crime in a city.
     Ans:
        library(corrplot)
        >corrplot(c)
        >corrplot(c,method = "pie")
        >corrplot(c,method = "color")
        >corrplot(c,method = "number")
        >corrplot(c,method = "pie")
        >corrplot(c,type = "lower")
     # top three reasons for having more crime in a city are FIPS_CTY ,IDNO , AGASSLT .

b. What is the difference between co-variance and correlation? Take an example from this dataset and
show the differences if any?
    Ans:

        BASIS FOR COMPARISON	       COVARIANCE	            CORRELATION


             Meaning	        Covariance is a measure         Correlation is a statistical 
                              indicating the extent to          measure that indicates how
                               which two random variables        strongly two variables
                                 change in tandem.	                 are related.
 

             What is it?	Measure of correlation	       Scaled version of covariance


               Values	        Lie between -∞ and +∞	       Lie between -1 and +1


          Change in scale	Affects covariance	       Does not affects correlation


          Unit free measure	         No	                     Yes

                                                 Cov(X,Y)
    Covariance vs. Correlation           ρ(X,Y)= ________
                                                 σX  σY 

             Where:

                   ρ(X,Y) – the correlation between the variables X and Y
                   Cov(X,Y) – the covariance between the variables X and Y
                   σX – the standard deviation of the X-variable
                   σY – the standard deviation of the Y-variable



       >cov(data$MURDER,data$BURGLRY)
       >cor(data$MURDER,data$BURGLRY)
        
       #in above code we have covariance 45282.7 and correlation  0.8653636

       >mydata<-data[1:1000,]
       >cov(mydata$MURDER,mydata$BURGLRY)
       >cor(mydata$MURDER,mydata$BURGLRY)

       # here we can see when scale is decreased we have covarience 129056.2   and correlation  0.8638122  


     # by this we can know the covarience is different and correlation in same
